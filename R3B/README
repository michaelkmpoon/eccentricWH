cdr        data for exter3b, also for LG3B
cdr.L      data for Lyapunov3b
cdr.sim    data for simple3b

These are 3-body codes:

exter3B.f         This allows external perturbations programed by the user (see comments in the code)
LG3B.f           Here soft potential allowed (NO ADVANTAGE FOR COMPUTATION)
Lyapunov3b.f     The variational equations are solved also
simple3b.f       This is a very simple (logaritmic leapfrog only) 3B code.

Symplectic3B.f   This is a symplectic 3B code for hierarchical 3B systems. Time transformed Wisdom-Holman-like system.
